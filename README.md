# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.

   Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability, making it ideal for both beginners and experienced developers.

Key Features:
Readable and Maintainable Code: Clean syntax and enforced indentation.
Dynamically Typed: No need for explicit variable type declaration.
Interpreted Language: Executes code line by line, facilitating easy debugging.
Extensive Standard Library: Rich library and numerous third-party modules.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Runs on multiple operating systems.
Use Cases:
Web Development: Frameworks like Django and Flask.
Data Analysis and Visualization: Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
Machine Learning and AI: Tools like TensorFlow and Scikit-learn.
Automation and Scripting: Scripts for automating repetitive tasks.
Game Development: Libraries such as Pygame.

2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.

Installation: Download from official website (Windows), use Homebrew (macOS), or package manager (Linux).
Verification: Check Python version using python --version (Windows) or python3 --version (macOS/Linux).
Virtual Environment: Create with python -m venv myenv, activate with source myenv/bin/activate, and deactivate with deactivate

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

# Simple Python program to print "Hello, World!"
print("Hello, World!")

Comments provide explanations and are prefixed with #.
Print Statements in Python 3.x use the print() function to output text to the console.
The "Hello, World!" string is enclosed in double quotes ("") to denote it as a string literal in Python.

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

   Integer (int):
Represents whole numbers, e.g., 0, 1, -5, 100.
Float (float):
Represents real numbers with a decimal point, e.g., 3.14, -0.001, 2.0.
String (str):
Represents sequences of characters enclosed in single (') or double (") quotes, e.g., 'Hello', "Python", '123'.
Boolean (bool):
Represents logical values indicating True or False.
List:
Ordered collection of items, mutable (can be changed), and can contain elements of different data types, e.g., [1, 2, 'three', True].
Tuple:
Ordered collection of items, immutable (cannot be changed), e.g., (1, 2, 'three').
Dictionary (dict):
Unordered collection of key-value pairs, mutable, e.g., {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}.

# Example
# Define variables of different data types
my_integer = 42
my_float = 3.14
my_string = "Hello, Python!"
my_boolean = True
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'four', False]
my_tuple = (10, 'eleven', 12.5)
my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}

# Print the variables and their types
print(f"my_integer: {my_integer}, type: {type(my_integer)}")
print(f"my_float: {my_float}, type: {type(my_float)}")
print(f"my_string: {my_string}, type: {type(my_string)}")
print(f"my_boolean: {my_boolean}, type: {type(my_boolean)}")
print(f"my_list: {my_list}, type: {type(my_list)}")
print(f"my_tuple: {my_tuple}, type: {type(my_tuple)}")
print(f"my_dict: {my_dict}, type: {type(my_dict)}")

# output
my_integer: 42, type: <class 'int'>
my_float: 3.14, type: <class 'float'>
my_string: Hello, Python!, type: <class 'str'>
my_boolean: True, type: <class 'bool'>
my_list: [1, 2, 3, 'four', False], type: <class 'list'>
my_tuple: (10, 'eleven', 12.5), type: <class 'tuple'>
my_dict: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}, type: <class 'dict'>


5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

Conditional Statements (if-else): Used to execute different blocks of code based on conditions (if for true condition, else for false condition).

# example
# Example of an if-else statement
x = 24
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")

Loops (for loop): Used to iterate over a sequence (like lists, tuples, dictionaries) or execute a block of code a specified number of times.

# example
# Example of a for loop
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)


6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

   Functions in Python are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They allow you to break down your program into smaller, modular pieces, making your code more organized, readable, and easier to maintain.

   # usefuliness
Modularity: Functions allow you to encapsulate code into reusable blocks, promoting code reuse and reducing redundancy.
Abstraction: They hide implementation details and provide an interface to interact with functionality, enhancing code readability and ease of use.
Organization: Functions help in organizing complex programs into manageable chunks, improving code structure and maintainability.

# Define a function that calculates the sum of two numbers
def sum_two_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# Example of calling the function
result = sum_two_numbers(5, 3)
print("Sum:", result)


7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

Lists:
Ordered Collection: Lists maintain the order of elements based on their insertion sequence.
Indexed Access: Elements are accessed using zero-based indexing (list[index]).
Mutable: Elements can be modified, added, or removed after the list is created.
Examples: [1, 2, 3, 'four', True]

Dictionaries:
Unordered Collection: Dictionaries do not maintain order among elements.
Key-Value Mapping: Elements are accessed using keys (dict[key]), where each key maps to a value.
Mutable: Both keys and values can be modified, added, or removed.
Examples: {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}

# example
# Create a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Create a dictionary with key-value pairs
person = {
    'name': 'Alice',
    'age': 25,
    'city': 'London'
}

# Print the initial list and dictionary
print("Initial list:", numbers)
print("Initial dictionary:", person)

# Accessing elements
print("\nAccessing elements:")
print("Second number in the list:", numbers[1])
print("Age of the person:", person['age'])

# Modifying elements
numbers[0] = 10
person['city'] = 'Paris'
print("\nModifying elements:")
print("Modified list:", numbers)
print("Modified dictionary:", person)

# Adding elements
numbers.append(6)
person['gender'] = 'Female'
print("\nAdding elements:")
print("List after adding element:", numbers)
print("Dictionary after adding key-value pair:", person)

# Removing elements
numbers.pop()
del person['age']
print("\nRemoving elements:")
print("List after removing last element:", numbers)
print("Dictionary after deleting 'age' key:", person)


8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

Exception handling in Python allows you to manage and respond to errors that occur during program execution, preventing crashes and enabling graceful recovery or termination.

# Components:
try block:
Encloses the code that may potentially raise an exception.
If an exception occurs within this block, Python looks for corresponding except blocks to handle it.
except block:
Catches specific exceptions or a general exception (Exception) that occurs within the try block.
Allows you to handle the exception, perform recovery actions, or log errors.
finally block:
Optional block that follows try and except blocks.
Executes regardless of whether an exception occurred or not, useful for cleanup actions (closing files, releasing resources).

# example
# Example: Handling division by zero error
# Function to perform division
def divide_numbers(x, y):
    try:
        result = x / y
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}. Cannot divide by zero!")
    else:
        print(f"Division result: {result}")
    finally:
        print("Execution completed.")
# Example usage
divide_numbers(10, 2)   # No exception
divide_numbers(10, 0)   # Exception: division by zero


9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

Modules:
Modules in Python are files containing Python code, typically with functions, classes, and variables.
They allow you to organize code into reusable units.
Examples include math.py, random.py, etc.

Packages:
Packages are directories containing multiple modules and an __init__.py file.
They help organize and structure Python's module namespace hierarchically.
Examples include numpy, pandas, etc.

  # import 
  To use a module in your Python script, you typically use the import statement:
# Importing a module
## import module_name
# Using functions or variables from the module
## module_name.function_name()
## module_name.variable_name

# Example: Using the math module
# Importing the math module
import math
# Using functions from the math module
print("Square root of 16:", math.sqrt(16))   # Using sqrt function
print("Value of pi:", math.pi)               # Accessing pi constant
print("Ceiling of 3.7:", math.ceil(3.7))      # Using ceil function


10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

# Reading from a File:
To read from a file in Python, you typically follow these steps:
Open the File: Use the open() function with the file path and mode ('r' for reading).
Read the Content: Use methods like read(), readline(), or readlines() to read the content.
Close the File: Use the close() method to close the file after reading

# example
# Reading from a file and printing its content
# Open the file in read mode
file_path = 'sample.txt'
file = open(file_path, 'r')
# Read and print the content
content = file.read()
print("Content of", file_path, ":\n", content)
# Close the file
file.close()

# Writing to a File:
To write to a file in Python, you typically follow these steps:
Open the File: Use the open() function with the file path and mode ('w' for writing).
If the file does not exist, it will be created. If it exists, its contents will be overwritten.
Write to the File: Use the write() method to write data to the file.
Close the File: Use the close() method to close the file after writing.

# example 
# Writing a list of strings to a file
# List of strings to write to file
lines = [
    "First line\n",
    "Second line\n",
    "Third line\n"
]
# Open the file in write mode
file_path = 'output.txt'
file = open(file_path, 'w')
# Write each line to the file
file.writelines(lines)
# Close the file
file.close()
print(f"Lines written to {file_path}")
